# Password-Generator
A password Generator using Javascript

On this project, we were tasked with creating a password generator.
The password generator needed to be able to provdide a randomly generated password with a multitide of possible characters.

After clicking the generate button, a series of prompts will ask for criteria wanted in your password.

After all criteria are met, a randonly generated password between 8 - 128 characters will present itself.
